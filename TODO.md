- [x] Tested boot sequence and basic device flow.

## Phase 3: LoRa and Node-Specific Logic
- [x] Implemented LoRa basics and security in `micropython/lora.py`.
- [x] Developed remote node logic in `micropython/main.py`.
- [x] Developed base node logic in `micropython/main.py`.
- [x] Implemented frost/heat watch logic in `micropython/tmon.py`.
- [x] Implemented data transmission in `micropython/main.py`.
- [x] Tested multi-node LoRa communication and data relay.

## Phase 4: TMON Admin Plugin
- [x] Installation, schema, device mgmt, data handling, OTA, support, wiki, location hierarchy, APIs, UI polish, versioning, UC shared key, UNIT_ID/MACHINE_ID association, suspend/enable, global monitoring, analytics, firmware/plugin push, wiki sync, dashboards, uptime monitoring, remote settings, support portal, customer hierarchy, secure UC access.

### Issues to Resolve & Polishing Steps
- [ ] Firmware page not displaying (submenu, template, permissions, UI polish).
- [ ] Device location page security error (menu removal, move logic, comments, form polish).
- [ ] Move purge data button/function (to includes/settings.php, UI parity, admin notices).
- [ ] Audit page enhancement (verbosity, filter/search, paginate/export, UI polish).
- [ ] Provisioning page redundancy (unified form, tabs/accordions, polish).
- [ ] Provisioned device actions (buttons, handlers, confirmations, polish).
- [ ] Device registration not showing (queries/joins, insert/display, notices, empty states).
- [ ] Location push logic (accessible via provisioning, comments, autocomplete/validation).
- [ ] Non-functional UC pages (menu registration, templates, permissions, UI polish).

## Phase 5: TMON Unit Connector Plugin
- [x] Installation and key refresh, provisioning API, field data rx/normalize/forward, dashboards/templates polish, periodic check-in & settings update, integration with Admin, UC shared key obtain/refresh, approved-assignments filtering, remote manageability, dashboards/shortcodes, data export & device info, connectivity monitoring/alerting.

## Phase 6: System Integration and Polish
- [ ] Uniform UI/UX (colors, buttons, tables).
- [ ] Tooltips/help/icons, responsiveness/accessibility.
- [ ] Loading spinners and empty states.
- [ ] End-to-end tests, docs/screenshots.

## Updated Next Actions (Scope-aligned)

Firmware (Micropython)
- [x] Dedicated LoRa loop; disabled for wifi role.
- [x] Gate field-data send until URL present; command poll continues post-provision.
- [x] Persist NODE_TYPE and gate tasks until fully provisioned.
- [ ] Base <-> Remote LoRa command/data envelope: HMAC + replay protection; payload encryption optional.
- [ ] Implement custom function runner and variable setter dispatcher on device (mapped from wprest.poll_device_commands payloads).

Admin (TMON Admin plugin)
- [x] Restore Audit page & logger.
- [x] Add UC endpoints: /uc/devices, /uc/reprovision, /uc/command.
- [ ] Wire audit logs into all key flows (provision save, queue enqueue, UC pushes, firmware jobs).
- [ ] Ensure assigned_to_uc flag updates when UC claims devices (mirror back via endpoint or scheduled sync).

Unit Connector
- [x] Mirror table ensure + refresh both assigned/unassigned devices.
- [x] Reprovision staging & push to Admin hub.
- [x] Commands page: set_var, run_func, firmware_update.
- [ ] Widgets/graphs for device data; relay controls; dashboards polishing.
- [ ] Shortcodes for per-device and grouped displays with settings management.

Docs/QA
- [x] README overview updated.
- [ ] Screenshots and data flow graphics.
- [ ] End-to-end tests: first-boot, reprovision, command dispatch, LoRa relay.

## Testing Log
- [ ] Verify UC refresh populates devices after Admin provisioning handoff.
- [ ] Send set_var (e.g., ENABLE_OLED) and confirm device applies.
- [ ] Send run_func (e.g., tmon.py frost/heat handler) to base and confirm remote relays.

## Commit Log
- [ ] Commit Admin UC endpoints, UC provisioning/commands pages.
- [ ] Tag minor release after QA.

# TODO

- [x] Mirror provisioned settings to tmon_devices (provisioned, wordpress_api_url, unit_name, provisioned_at) on Save & Provision.
- [x] Migration: add provisioned/provisioned_at/wordpress_api_url columns if missing.
- [x] Deliver staged provisioning to devices (settings_staged).
- [x] Add device confirm endpoint with token; device posts confirm after apply.
- [x] Admin UI Provisioning Activity page with pending queue and history.
- [x] Add history auditing/logging option in Admin.
- [ ] Add per-device HMAC confirmation or device-specific key to confirm endpoint.
- [ ] Add email notifications for provisioning events (optional).
- [ ] Add per-device staging preview and direct push tools in UI.
- [ ] Add tests to verify full provisioning lifecycle.

# TMON Admin — Updated TODO

Completed (from this session)
- Fixed fatal parse error at file end.
- Restored redirect-after-POST in `admin_post_tmon_admin_provision_device`.
- Added firmware fields and GitHub manifest fetch (AJAX: `tmon_admin_fetch_github_manifest`).
- Added migrations: normalized IDs, firmware metadata, settings_staged, device mirror columns.
- Queue helpers: enqueue/dequeue/lookup by normalized keys.
- Diagnostics: known IDs refresh, queue/DB staging check, API calls and provisioning history tables.
- Claims approval/denial flow and provisioning history page.

High-priority
- Define missing vars in inline update branch in provisioning page.
- Validate nonce usage across forms/handlers.
- Confirm device-side queue consumption and normalized key matching.

Medium
- Device mirror consistency updates and backfills.
- Admin notices reliability.
- Hierarchy Sync audit logs.

Lower-priority
- UX: typeahead for Known IDs; loading spinners.
- Security: verify cross-site tokens and rotation.
- Maintenance: centralize purge ops in settings.php; docs.
- Docs: admin guide for provisioning workflow and diagnostics.

Notes
- Migrations idempotent; keep in `admin_init`.
- Unique index `unit_machine (unit_id, machine_id)` ensures deduplication; ensure updates match normalized columns.
